# ZOS

## How To install beta

in order to opt into beta you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/).

now that that's installed you can clone the project on your desktop by typing in the command prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/77z/os.git
```

now you should have a folder called os somewhere.

next just change the directory of the command prompt to the "os" folder.

```
cd os
```

now type

```
npm start
```

and you're up and running!

if a new version comes out go into the terminal on the OS folder and type

```
git pull
```

also with latest version there is auto updating!!
